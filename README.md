# using-gfpgan-for-video-recovery
1. Installation of necessary libraries
opencv-python: Used for computer vision tasks, such as face detection.
basicsr==1.4.2: Provides tools for image and video super-resolution.
gfpgan==1.3.8: Specifically for face restoration using GFPGAN.
torchvision==0.14.0: PyTorch's computer vision utilities for image and video processing.
2. Video Download and Face Extraction
Downloads a video using wget and saves it as 'video.mp4'.
Loads a pre-trained Haar Cascade face detection model from OpenCV.
Reads the video frame-by-frame using cv2.VideoCapture.
Detects faces in each frame using the face detection model.
Finds the largest detected face in the frame.
Crops the largest face, adding padding for better context.
Resizes the cropped face to 512x512 pixels.
Saves the cropped face to the 'cropped_faces' directory.
3. Face Restoration with GFPGAN
Sets input and output directories for face restoration.
Loads the GFPGAN model.
Iterates through images in the input directory.
Opens each image and converts it to RGB format.
Uses GFPGAN to enhance the face in the image.
Saves the restored image to the output directory.
4. Video Generation from Restored Faces
Defines a function generate_video_from_images that:
Reads images from a directory.
Sorts the images by name.
Determines video dimensions.
Creates a VideoWriter object.
Writes each image to the video.
Releases the VideoWriter.
Calls generate_video_from_images to create a video from restored faces, saving it as 'output_video.mp4'.
